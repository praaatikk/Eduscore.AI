EduScore.AI — Student Performance Prediction Web App

EduScore.AI is a Flask-based machine learning web application that predicts a student’s final exam performance based on demographic and academic factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation.
It features user authentication, prediction history, and a clean Bootstrap-based UI.




🚀 Features

✅ Machine Learning Integration

Predicts student exam performance using a pre-trained ML model (model.pkl).

✅ User Authentication

Secure registration and login system with hashed passwords.

Session-based login management.

✅ Prediction Dashboard

Users can input details and get instant predicted scores.

Option to view past predictions (if enabled).

✅ Responsive Frontend

Modern Bootstrap 5 interface.

Consistent layout with navigation bar and flash messages.

✅ Persistent Database

SQLite used for storing users and predictions.

Auto-created on first run.
